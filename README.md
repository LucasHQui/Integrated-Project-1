# Integrated-Project-1

You work for the online store Ice, which sells video games worldwide. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (for example, Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available in open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine whether a game is successful or not. This will allow you to identify potential hits and plan advertising campaigns.

The data provided dates back to 2016. Let's imagine that we are in December 2016 and you are planning a campaign for 2017.

(The important thing is to have experience working with data. It really doesn't matter if you are predicting 2017 sales based on 2016 data or 2027 sales based on 2026 data.)
 
The dataset contains a "rating" column that stores the ESRB rating of each game. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates the content of a game and assigns an age rating, such as Teen or Mature.
